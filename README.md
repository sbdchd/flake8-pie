## lints

### PIE781: assign-and-return

Based on Clippy's
[`let_and_return`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#let_and_return)
and Microsoft's TSLint rule
[`no-unnecessary-local-variable`](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib).

For more info on the structure of this lint, see the [accompanying blog
post](https://steve.dignam.xyz/2018/12/16/creating-a-flake8-lint/).

#### examples

```python
# error
def foo():
   x = bar()
   return x

# allowed
def foo():
   x, _ = bar()
   return x
```

### PIE783: celery-explicit-names

Warn about [Celery](https://pypi.org/project/celery/) task definitions that don't have explicit names.

Note: this lint is kind of naive considering any decorator with a `.task()`
method or any decorator called `shared_task()` a Celery decorator.

#### examples

```python
# error
@app.task()
def foo():
    pass

# ok
@app.task(name="app_name.tasks.foo")
def foo():
    pass
```

### PIE784: celery-explicit-crontab-args

The `crontab` class provided by Celery has some default args that are
suprising to new users. Specifically, `crontab(hour="0,12")` won't run a task
at midnight and noon, it will run the task at every minute during those two
hours. This lint makes that call an error, forcing you to write
`crontab(hour="0, 12", minute="*")`.

Additionally, the lint is a bit more complex in that it requires you specify
every smaller increment than the largest time increment you provide. So if you
provide `days_of_week`, then you need to provide `hour`s and `minute`s
explicitly.

Note: if you like the default behavior of `crontab()` then you can either
disable this lint or pass `"*"` for the `kwarg` value, e.g., `minutes="*"`.

Also, since this lint is essentially a naive search for calls to a
`crontab()` function, if you have a function named the same then this will
cause false positives.

### PIE785: celery-require-tasks-expire

Celery tasks can bunch up if they don't have expirations.

This enforces specifying expirations in both the celery beat config dict and
in `.apply_async()` calls.

The same caveat applies about how this lint is naive.

### PIE786: precise-exception-handlers

Be precise in what exceptions you catch. Bare `except:` handlers, catching `BaseException`, or catching `Exception` can lead to unexpected bugs.

#### examples

```python
# error
try:
    save_file(name="export.csv")
except:
    pass

# error
try:
    save_file(name="export.csv")
except BaseException:
    pass

# error
try:
    save_file(name="export.csv")
except Exception:
    pass

# error
try:
    save_file(name="export.csv")
except (ValueError, Exception):
    pass


# ok
try:
    save_file(name="export.csv")
except OSError:
    pass
```

### PIE787: no-len-condition

Empty collections are fasley in Python so calling `len()` is unnecessary when
checking for emptiness in an if statement/expression.

Comparing to explicit scalars is allowed.

```python
# error
if len(foo): ...
if not len(foo): ...

# ok
if foo: ...
if not foo: ...
if len(foo) > 0: ...
if len(foo) == 0: ...
```

### PIE788: no-bool-condition

If statements/expressions evalute the truthiness of the their test argument,
so calling `bool()` is unnecessary.

Comparing to `True`/`False` is allowed.

```python
# error
if bool(foo): ...
if not bool(foo): ...

# ok
if foo: ...
if not foo: ...
if bool(foo) is True: ...
if bool(foo) is False: ...
```

### PIE789: prefer-isinstance-type-compare

Using `type()` doesn't take into account subclassess and type checkers won't
refine the type, use `isinstance` instead.

```python
# error
if type(foo) == str: ...
if type(foo) is str: ...
if type(foo) in [int, str]: ...

# ok
if isinstance(foo, str): ...
if isinstance(foo, (int, str)): ...
```

### PIE790: no-unnecessary-pass

`pass` is unnecessary when definining a `class` or function with an empty
body.

```python
# error
class BadError(Exception):
    """
    some doc comment
    """
    pass

def foo() -> None:
    """
    some function
    """
    pass

# ok
class BadError(Exception):
    """
    some doc comment
    """

def foo() -> None:
    """
    some function
    """
```

### PIE791: no-pointless-statements

Comparisions without an assignment or assertion are probably a typo.

```python
# error
"foobar" in data
res.json() == []
user.is_authenticated() is True

# ok
assert "foobar" in data
foo = res.json() == []
use.is_authenticated()
```

### PIE792: no-inherit-object

Inheriting from `object` isn't necessary in Python 3.

```python
# error
class Foo(object):
    ...

# ok
class Foo:
    ...
```

### PIE793: prefer-dataclass

Attempts to find cases where the `@dataclass` decorator is unintentionally
missing.

```python
# error
class Foo:
    z: dict[int, int]
    def __init__(self) -> None: ...

class Bar:
    x: list[str]

# ok
class Bar(Foo):
    z: dict[int, int]

@dataclass
class Bar:
    x: list[str]
```

### PIE794: dupe-class-field-definitions

Finds duplicate definitions for the same field, which can occur in large ORM
model definitions.

```python
# error
class User(BaseModel):
    email = fields.EmailField()
    # ...80 more properties...
    email = fields.EmailField()

# ok
class User(BaseModel):
    email = fields.EmailField()
    # ...80 more properties...
```

### PIE795: prefer-stdlib-enums

Instead of defining various constant properties on a class, use the stdlib
enum which typecheckers support for type refinement.

```python
# error
class Foo:
    A = "A"
    B = "B"
    C = "C"

# ok
import enum
class Foo(enum.Enum):
    A = "A"
    B = "B"
    C = "C"
```

### PIE796: prefer-unique-enums

By default the stdlib enum allows multiple field names to map to the same
value, this lint requires each enum value be unique.

```python
# error
class Foo(enum.Enum):
    A = "A"
    B = "B"
    C = "C"
    D = "C"

# ok
class Foo(enum.Enum):
    A = "A"
    B = "B"
    C = "C"
    D = "D"
```

### PIE797: no-unecessary-if-expr

Call `bool()` directly rather than reimplementing its functionality.

```python
# error
foo(is_valid=True if buzz() else False)

# ok
foo(is_valid=bool(buzz()))
```
